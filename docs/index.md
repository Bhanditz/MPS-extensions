# Welcome to the MPS Extensions

The MPS Extension aim to provide a set of various useful extensions to MPS.

## Getting Started

## Versions

The version number reflects the MPS version the extensions are compatible with. For instance `2018.1.X` is compatible with MPS 2018.1, `2017.3.X` is compatible with MPS 2017.3.6. We only maintain compatibility with the latest minor release for each major version. While a `2017.3.x` version of the extension might with a on older version than MPS 2017.3.6 we only test it against the latest.
